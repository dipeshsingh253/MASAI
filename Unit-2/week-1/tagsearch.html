        <h1>b tag</h1>
        <p>
            The <b> b HTML element</b> is used to draw the reader's attention to the element's contents, which are not otherwise granted special importance. This was formerly known as the Boldface element, and most browsers still draw the text in boldface. However, you should not use <b>b</b> for styling text; instead, you should use the CSS font-weight property to create boldface text, or the element to indicate that text is of special importance.
        </p>

        <h1>i tag</h1>
        <p>
            The <i> i </i> HTML element represents a range of text that is set off from the normal text for some reason, such as idiomatic text, technical terms, taxonomical designations, among others. Historically, these have been presented using italicized type, which is the original source of the <i> i </i> naming of this element.
        </p>
        <h1>u tag</h1>
        <p>
            The <u> u HTML element</u> represents a span of inline text which should be rendered in a way that indicates that it has a non-textual annotation. This is rendered by default as a simple solid underline, but may be altered using CSS.
        </p>
        <h1>select tag</h1>
        <p>
            The  <b> select </b>element has some unique attributes you can use to control it, such as multiple to specify whether multiple options can be selected, and size to specify how many options should be shown at once. It also accepts most of the general form input attributes such as required, disabled, autofocus, etc. 
        </p>
        <h1>button tag</h1>
        <p>
            The <b>button</b> element is an interactive element activated by a user with a mouse, keyboard, finger, voice command, or other assistive technology. Once activated, it then performs a programmable action, such as submitting a form or opening a dialog.
